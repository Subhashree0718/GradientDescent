# Linear Regression with Gradient Descent and Brute Force Search

## Overview

### This project estimates the best-fit slope for a dataset using two approaches:

- **Brute-Force Search** – Iterates over a range of slope values to find the one that minimizes the absolute error.  
- **Gradient Descent** – Optimizes the slope iteratively to minimize the **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** efficiently.  

The project includes **data visualization, loss tracking, and a comparison** between the two methods.

## Features

✅ **Generates synthetic linear data with noise**  
✅ Implements a **brute-force search** for the best slope  
✅ Uses **gradient descent** for efficient slope optimization  
✅ **Visualizes** results, including:  
   - The generated dataset  
   - Error vs. slope graph (**Brute-Force Search**)  
   - Loss reduction over iterations (**Gradient Descent**)  
   - Best-fit line comparisons  
✅ **Modular object-oriented implementation**

## Installation

Ensure you have **Python** installed. Then, install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
